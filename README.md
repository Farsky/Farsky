# Skybrief
Years of experience in Software Development makes me realize that in order to survive, you need to change, grow and collaborate. And I have all of them.

I would love to make an impact wherever I go. Be it incident troubleshooting, performance improvements, architectural decisions, technology R&D, I have done all of them. Besides, I would love nothing else than to challenge myself to reach new heights.

I'm open to any techs, just give me time and I can figure them out on my own. Currently learning the AWS and Azure fundamentals. And Python for future opportunities.

      Those who prefer the Confident Individualism Strategy like doing things alone, choosing to rely on their own
